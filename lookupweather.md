One line to know what the weather is for today and the next two days in your area.

curl wttr.in/my-city

Replace "my-city" with your city or town (not case-sensitive) and if there are multiple places named that, 
put in the zip code of the county it's in but sometimes it takes a few tries with different zip codes for 
that county if it has multiple zip codes.

For Pittsburgh:
curl wttr.in/15106

If your city has more than one word in the name, put a "+" in between each word.

curl wttr.in/salt+lake+city

You can also put in the abbreviation for an airport such as for the airport in Atlanta:

curl wttr.in/atl
